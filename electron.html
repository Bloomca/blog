<h1>Electron.js Overview Guide</h1>

<p>
    When I started working on the Electron applications, coming from the web, a lot of things were really confusing. What is the "DOM" of native GUI development? What exactly is the difference between platforms? What is a set of "normal" Desktop features, and where exactly are they defined?
</p>
<p>
    This guide won't answer all of these questions, but it should give a solid overview of what a typical native application has in terms of the OS integration.
