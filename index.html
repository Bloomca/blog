<h1>Hi there!</h1>
<p>
  I am Seva, and I do software development, nowadays cross-platform desktop development.<br />
  I use this website to publish <a href="/posts">my articles</a>, and I publish nearly all my code on my <a href="https://github.com/Bloomca">GitHub</a>.
</p>

<h2>
  My recent projects:
</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="https://github.com/Bloomca/Piktosaur">Piktosaur</a> -- WinUI 3 photo gallery application; it is focused on minimal interface and automatic images search in nested folders (so you don't need to click through folders manually).
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://github.com/Bloomca/Streakosaur">Streakosaur</a> -- SwiftUI application for macOS to manage your streaks. Instead of a binary status where you have a streak length, it focuses on your customizable success rate and evaluates periods based on that.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://github.com/Bloomca/veles">Veles</a> -- web UI library with focus on performance. Conceptually it ended up pretty similar to <a href="https://www.solidjs.com/">Solid.js</a> with simple Observables primitive, atomic updates and simplified components lifecycle.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://github.com/Bloomca/win32-pomodoro-timer">Win32 Pomodoro Timer</a> -- super simple Win32 application in order to understand how GUI applications on Windows process events.
  </li>
</ul>
