    Hi! My name is Seva, and I am a software developer for about ~<script>
      var now = new Date();
      document.write(now.getFullYear() - 2013);
    </script> years.
    <br />
    I am a self-taught developer, and for the most part of my career I have been working on the Web applications. I mostly work on the Frontend, although I have some experience with writing server-side code using Node.js.
  </p>
  <p>
    I was always interested in complex applications, how they are architected, how the state management is organized, and how to improve performance. I really like to learn how things work on the low level, so I've built my own UI library for the web: <a href="https://github.com/Bloomca/veles">Veles</a>, and a simple <a href="https://github.com/Bloomca/win32-pomodoro-timer">Win32 application</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    For the last 2 years I've been working on the Electron applications. Ever since I am digging the rabbit hole of native and cross-platform Desktop development, learning both how all the OSes work and which APIs they provide. I've been learning and making applications with WinUI, SwiftUI, and how low-level code is compiled and linked together, and how different languages can be linked and communicate via C ABI.
